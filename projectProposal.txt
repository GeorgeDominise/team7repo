I was going to create a Google Doc for this, but wouldn't this be much more fun?

We need 6 functional requirements, and 4 non functional requirements. When adding requirements, add
both the exact name, a short description, and an idea of how you are going to create it. Let us go for
at least four low pass requirements, and two high pass requirements.

High Pass reqiurements should have an asterisk after its name. Feel free to add more requirements
after the required six/four needed (or in this case, as wanted).

===============

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Buy Item
	Description: The user is able to click a "BUY ITEM" button, and is given a page where they
		can input their address and credit card information.
	Idea: The "BUY ITEM" button redirects the user to another page (maybe on another tab? Could be
		called "\cardinput". After inputting information, there is a "SUBMIT" button that
		checks to make sure all the String inputs are filled out. Redirects user to buy page
		(Maybe include a flash message that says "You have successfully purchased this item.")
2. Login (Maryia)
        Description: The user is able to input their username and password and click the "Login" button. If the credentials match,
                the user is redirected to their profile page.
        Idea: Login page would be a separate page with two input fields for user's username and password.
                It would also have a "Login" button. When the button is clicked, the program would check if the information
                entered is correct, and if it is, the user would be redirected to their profile page ( or just the home page with
                the link to their profile on top of the page)
3. Logout (Maryia)
        Description: The user would be able to sign out of their profile by clicking on the "Logout" button. When signed out, the
                        user would be redirected to the home page.
        Idea: Logout button might be implemented on the user's profile page. When the user clicks the button, he would be signed
                out of their profile and then taken back to the home page.
4. Add to cart (Maryia)
        Description: The user would be able to add an item to their cart by clicking the "Add to cart" button.
        Idea: When the "Add to cart" button is clicked, a specific item is added to a dictionary, where the name of the
                item is the key, and the amount of items is the value. There might also be a button to chenge the number of items
                the user wants to add, and them when the button is clicked, the number would be the value for that key. Can be
                combined with a "View the cart" requirement.

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Expected to work on multiple browsers (Maryia)
        Idea: The program should be able to run on multiple browsers (Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox) in order to
                be more accessible to users who only have access to one of those browsers.
