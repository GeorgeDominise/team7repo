I was going to create a Google Doc for this, but wouldn't this be much more fun?

We need 6 functional requirements, and 4 non functional requirements. When adding requirements, add
both the exact name, a short description, and an idea of how you are going to create it. Let us go for
at least four low pass requirements, and two high pass requirements.

High Pass reqiurements should have an asterisk after its name. Feel free to add more requirements
after the required six/four needed (or in this case, as wanted).

===============

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Buy Item
	Description: The user is able to click a "BUY ITEM" button, and is given a page where they
		can input their address and credit card information.
	Idea: The "BUY ITEM" button redirects the user to another page (maybe on another tab? Could be
		called "\cardinput". After inputting information, there is a "SUBMIT" button that
		checks to make sure all the String inputs are filled out. Redirects user to buy page
		(Maybe include a flash message that says "You have successfully purchased this item.")
